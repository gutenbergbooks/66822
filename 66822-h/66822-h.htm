<p class="drop-cap">Charles Wesley once said, “There is no reason why the
devil should have all of the best tunes,” and it is equally
hard to conceive why he should have all of the best pictures.
There is probably no phase of art which Satan has tried
harder to control than that of painting. He has sought to
corrupt literature, music and oratory, but even if he meets defeat
in each of these quarters, he will be fully resigned, if it remains in his
power, to make the pictorial artist his ready slave; for well the arch spirit of
evil knows that it is pictures that catch the eye, fasten the attention, quicken
the imagination and enthrall the soul.</p>
</div>

<p>For years and years the pen of the caricaturist was in the exclusive
service of the secular and humorous press. There it often did good work
as the champion of social and political reform. Nast, Gillam and Beard,
in their several fields of pictorial journalism, have laid the nation and the
world under deeper obligations than it will soon be able to repay. One of
that famous trio, however, not being content with his success in merely
amusing men, or at best in directing their thoughts to the foibles of politics,
and society, sought to enlarge his usefulness by consecrating his pen and his
genius to the betterment of the religious conditions of the race and hoped
thereby to bring men to a better understanding of themselves and their Maker.</p>

<p>It was Frank Beard, who, first among the great artists, used the pen of
caricature as a champion of Christian living and Christian reform. He could
have found no better opportunity to exercise his talent and distribute its
effects broadcast than in the pages of The Ram’s Horn, that wonderful
weekly paper which far and near is now known as “the miracle of modern
journalism.” For nearly three years Mr. Beard has given The Ram’s Horn
a full page cartoon each week and it is Fifty of the Best of these Pictures
which now appear in the pages of this volume.</p>

<p>The highest hopes of Mr. Beard and of The Ram’s Horn will be accomplished
if, by the publication of these pictures, stronger emphasis is laid upon
the fact that Christ is the foundation of the church, and good citizenship is
the foundation of the state, and that the only great foe to the former is
Unbelief, and as for the latter no good citizenship is possible so long as it remains
in an unholy league with the licensed saloon.</p>

<p>By Faith the walls of Jericho fell down flat.    Hebrews xi:30.</p>

<p>At a long blast with the ram’s horn the walls of the city shall
fall.    Josh. vi:5.</p>

<p>Fifty loud blasts from The Ram’s Horn will be found in this book of
Cartoons. At their reverberating peal may the walls of Mammon, Rum and
Unbelief fall shattered in the dust.</p>

<p class="cap">The church can scarcely be said to be somnolent. It is
awake and active. But its activities are too frequently
spent in affairs that do not relate to its mission which
is to fight the hosts of sin in a wicked world. The giants of
iniquity stalk forth boldly. They find the church not in battle
but in the tents, feasting and drinking, planning for dime socials
and not for war against sin. Oh that some modern David
would soon step forth and teach us that it is not shields nor
armor nor tall steeples nor worldly expedients that are to win
the day. It is faith in God. That is what gave aim and speed
to the stone that slew Goliath, and it is what will give efficacy
now to work and prayer.</p>

<p class="cap">It was fortunate that the Savior did not build his church
upon a perishable foundation. When in answer to his inquiry
Peter said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living
God, Jesus had a corner stone for an edifice whose summit
would reach the stars and whose base would be as broad as
creation. The church is founded upon a fact and that fact is
the historic Christ. No lever of human assumption bolstered by
conceit has ever moved that corner stone the breadth of a hair.
The church of Jesus is founded upon the impeccable, the faithful,
the everlasting Christ who is the same yesterday, today and
forever. Touch not the walls of Truth which surround Zion.
They are impregnable.</p>

<p class="cap">Hard and exacting is the toil of the preacher. Especially
so in these years when a cultured and enlightened
pew demands the religious discourse presented in the
best form and embellished with the adornments which modern
art and literature supply. A preacher who yields to the extreme
demands of modern thought, however, will soon find himself
abandoning the true and best source of sermon material and
will begin to forage in the desert fields of literature to find sustenance
for an impoverished mind. Many such a preacher, tired
and heartless, would find instant relief if he would but burn the
human aids to the manufacture of artificial sermons and turn
to the rich mines of truth which still lie unexplored in the sacred
word. Back to Christ is the call of a starving world which
is now shepherdless and unfed.</p>

<p class="cap">The preachers are not alone guilty of levying tribute
from the world in carrying on the work of the gospel.
There are church organizations which might be numbered
by the thousands, the wealth of whose membership would
in each congregation exceed a million dollars, but they seem
unable to buy a church organ or a pulpit bible without getting
up a bazaar or a Church Fair. The same Jesus who drove the
money changers from the house of prayer, sits in sad judgment
upon the church which turns its sacred chamber into a market
place or into a scene of rank levity and low grade amusement.</p>

<p class="cap">There were but few gifts recorded in the bible which
were large enough to attract the attention of Christ.
They were not large but they all implied sacrifice,
they represented the utmost that the giver could bestow. When
the widow bashfully pushed her little mite into the collection
box she little dreamed that her offering weighed more than all
the gold and precious treasure that lay stacked in the safety
deposit vaults of Jerusalem. If God has a cordial contempt for
anybody in the world, we suspect it is for the man who, having
made a fortune, gives ostentatiously a part which is insignificant
in proportion to the amount which he retains to minister to his
own comfort and ease.</p>

than complete surrender, whether of the will or of
wealth. “What lack I yet?” asked the rich young
man who prided himself extravagantly on his moral life. Go,
said Jesus, sell your estate and give the proceeds to the needy.
We have no evidence that this young Jew got his money in
any but an honest method, and if his way to salvation lay
along the path of complete surrender what shall those do who
derive their riches by corrupting law makers and by defeating
justice, and by cornering products and raising the price of food?</p>

dwell. Its sacred precincts are more inviolate than the
inner sanctuary of Israel’s temple. God has made it
the ark of his covenant between himself and his children from
generation to generation. It is the oracle and fount for instruction
in religion and morals and patriotism. It is the altar where
holy fires of ambition and inspiration and enthusiasm are kindled.
And yet there are those, and sometimes there are women,
who see no opportunity for deep pleasure or high duty
at the home fireside, but must find it in outside engagements,
in pursuit of baubles of worldly place or social distinction.
This is not woman’s sphere. Her hand belongs not on the

begins to take form. There she belongs and there she
may sit to mold the future of two worlds. Only of such will

shores into a garden of plenty. He conquered nature,
by reason of his kindly acts even the wild animals learned to

strong contrast to him is the man who heaps opulence upon
greed and by his selfishness separates himself from the companionship
of men. Faith, Hope and Love, once his attendants,

with contentment is great gain, says the bible, and
therein is the secret of a rich and happy life. Contentment
is a prerequisite of happiness and no man can come into contentment
until every aspiration of his nature is satisfied. The
deepest aspiration that lodges in the human soul is the longing
for that contentment and rest which salvation bestows. No one
is really rich, therefore, until salvation is found, and if it be discovered,
after heroic sacrifice and struggle, after plunging through
temptation and peril, the joy of triumph will be that much the
greater and when temptation has been conquered by faith and
works, then Salvation makes one truly the Richest Man in the
World.</p>

<p class="cap">More than one man has been hanged for doing what
he did not mean to do. When anyone under the influence
of liquor commits a crime it is no longer an
extenuation or defense to say that he was not responsible. This
is so because it is a matter of human experience that if one sets
a match to gunpowder it will explode and if one pours liquor
down his throat he is filling his brain with the seeds of malice,
hate and murder. Many a man has scoffed at such a statement
at twelve o’clock at night, but has seen awful proof of its truth,
when, awakening at nine in the morning he recovers from a fatal
debauch and sees the work of his own drunken and murderous
hand.</p>

verdict which can be rendered by intelligence and patriotism.
Ten thousand times ten thousand times it has
been brought before the bar of Justice and there charged and
proved with being responsible for the vast majority of poverty,
crime and disease which infest the race. Nevertheless, so deeply
is this blighting curse intrenched in our laws and government that
our courts are compelled, even if unwilling, to protect a traffic

this, the saloonist seeks refuge under the cloak of the law, and
there insolently defies us to assail him.</p>

young English officer and his command, at the battle
of Inkerman, which gallant feat probably decided the
fate of the day. Satan has planted his batteries for the destruction
of the American home, and from every saloon in the land
the wicked bombardment goes on, day and night, year after
year, and every hour of every day some new house is sighted
for destruction. Shall this cruel and desolating fire upon the
American home forever continue? God forbid! “Spike that
gun!” is the word of command that has gone forth to the great
temperance host. “Spike that gun!” is the shout that rings out
all along the lines of the great home protection army as they
rush to the final charge. “Spike that gun!” shall be our battle
cry until the last battery of hell has been silenced and every
home in our land is safe from this desolating fire.</p>

resting now and then for refreshment or ease. It is during
these periods of rest that Satan employs every art
to wrest from the traveler his dearest possession, his crown of
life, which secures him an ample entrance to the heavenly city
beyond. Folly, which represents the sensuous pleasures of the
world, is employed to display her gaudy charms in order that
the eye of the wayfarer may be turned aside and give Satan
the opportunity to snatch the coveted treasure. At such moments
let the Christian keep his crown before his eye, nor let
him look back at the allurements and false pleasures which he
has left behind. For, as a reward for this vigilance, a crown of
life is assured him, one that is imperishable and brilliant and
that fadeth not away.</p>

of water which fall two hundred feet below, there is a
rainbow seen almost constantly when the sun is shining,
and within the circle of color some have seen the form of
a beautiful maiden. One who was in a boat above the falls
might see this entrancing vision and drop his oars and gaze
rapturously, until, all unconscious, his boat glides over the brink
and to destruction. The Christian also is in danger of such a
fate. The world offers beauty and pleasure, and in such fascinating
forms that it takes resolute will to keep from dropping the
oars and drifting with the current of temptation and letting
the good boat, which would save us, glide over the precipice into
sin and into death.</p>

that would not be brooked from preacher or friend. True character
divested of conventional habiliments of conduct through

rage when the artist began to paint out of his portrait a slight

me, let not my real self be hidden!”</p>

and swiftly, there shipwreck is most frequent and we
place Rescue Missions at these points. But do we
ever think of there being rescue missions in the skies? Could
we scan the far battlements of heaven we might, perhaps, see
them lined with hosts of angels watching and waiting to
descend to the rescue of some tender child whom it were better
to snatch away to scenes of glory, than leave it in an atmosphere
that reeks with moral contagion. It was such a scene as
appears on the page opposite that Isaiah saw when he wrote
“He shall gather the lambs with his arm and shall carry them
in his bosom.”</p>

appeals of childhood. It is an evidence of Christ’s
greatness, that he delighted not in the patronage and
intercourse of the influential and mighty, but sought the friendship
and love of children. Their credentials to His favor are
not based upon race, or station, creed or complexion. Their
frankness, their innocence, their simplicity, place them in nomination
and his great heart immediately responds to those traits.
“Suffer little children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom
of heaven.” Unless ye become as a little child (in frankness
and simplicity and innocence) ye shall not enter the kingdom
of heaven.</p>

In the synagogue, or the highway, or at the table, they

instead of solace. Christ may come to us when and where

amidst the storm, which modern science has engendered, and
in which the brave gospel ship is rocking, Christ himself should
come to the frightened student of His word and say, “It is I, be

<p class="cap">In the midst of life we are in death, in the midst of joy we
are in sorrow and in the midst of luxury we are in want.
There are more kinds of luxury than those which mere
wealth can bring, and there are kinds of want as many—luxury
is a state of abundance, whether of wealth, or books, or intellect,
or privileges beyond our personal need. Want is a state of
poverty of clothes, or food, or of physical or mental necessities of
whatever sort. It is a fact that one half of the world possesses
that which the other half needs. The poor need the assistance
of the rich in matters of physical comforts and counsel. The
rich need the meekness and patience which are the soonest found
in the lowly cottage or the pauper’s hut. The world will
reach its ideal state when every one, as his brother’s keeper, will
vie with each other in a wholesale interchange of fellowship and
goods. The barrier to this glad consummation is the selfish indifference
with which one half of the world works and worships.
It is blind to the constant presence of want which has claims to
be paid. Until these debts to duty are discharged worship will
be a mockery and religion a hollow show.</p>

is not written the record of a tragedy. It may come in
the loss of a friend, or a parent, or a wife or husband,
or a child. It may come in the wreck of a fortune or the
stranding of a worldly ambition. Some day while pursuing a
peaceful voyage the cry will go forth, “Breakers ahead,” and
in spite of our vigilance and our prayers the stout ship will
founder and we will be cast upon untrodden shores of duty and
experience. It is in such emergencies as these that the Christian
has resources that the man of the world knows not of. Unlike
Crusoe he does not turn his desperate gaze toward the half-sunken
ship if perchance he may regain some of its stores. He
recalls rather those sweet promises of God which await redemption
in the hour of need. “I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee.” He remembers that and forthwith in the midst of his
extreme peril and helplessness he cries: I will lift up mine eyes
unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh
from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Psalms 121:1–2.</p>

such close and tender relations with His people as that
of Shepherd. “I am the Good Shepherd and know
my sheep and am known of mine.” As members of the fold of
Christ we are guaranteed His loving care and solicitous protection.
“But other sheep I have which are not of this fold.” By
that He means that His shepherding care extends over the entire
world, and no bruised or fallen lamb exposed to the rocks
and hardships of the wilderness, can ever get beyond the Shepherd’s
patient search. No winds can be too harsh, no storms
too angry, no mountain steeps too treacherous to defeat his patient
will to reclaim the lost. Though by ignorance we fall
into error and violate his commands, though by willfulness we
transgress His law and traverse the road of disobedience, though
the lamp of our innocence be shattered and the light of our
hope fades away in desolation and despair, the Shepherd comes

in human experience. It sows nettles in the pillow of
poverty, and even the merchant, farmer and banker
pursue a weary existence when they are compelled to live under
the shadow of overhanging indebtedness. How many hearts
would be lightened today if by some magic stroke their books
of debit and credit were balanced and for once they could feel
and know that they owed no man anything. The weight
which financial indebtedness imposes is comparable only with
the weight which the debts of sin heap upon us. As we think
of the sins of envy, and of malice, and of hatred, falsehood,
deceit and cupidity, which our conscience has been justly charging
up against us since early years, the load becomes all but
intolerable. At this moment the great Debt Payer steps upon
the scene. He presents a check in payment of the entire
amount. It is payable to our order. He says, “Endorse this
and your account with sin is square.” As an evidence of our
love and faith we write our names with confidence and boldness
across the back of the check and step forth into life with
new hope and new determination.</p>

emotions and aspirations that are higher than those of the animal
kingdom. He may also rise still higher and think the
thoughts of God. To do so, however, one must approach God
in the proper attitude and in a manner consistent with His being.
God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth. They that approach the throne of mercy in
any other manner, whether in vaunting conceit or by impertinent
inquisition, will find the heavens a brazen canopy that will
send back the echo of their prayers. The starry skies reveal no

</div>


<p class="cap">So universal has the authority and influence of Jesus Christ
become that it is no longer possible to dispute his sway
by resort to argument. In the court of final appeal men
are forced to confess that he is the most matchless character, the
most loving and forgiving and patient man of history. The
majority of us are compelled to admit that such rare traits would
be impossible in a life that was less than divine. But there are
men who see no loveliness in him and if they can not attack
by argument they must attack him by abuse. They resort to
ridicule, blasphemy and falsehood, and though the spectacle thus
presented is one that shocks the finer sense in almost every human
heart, nevertheless there are those who will pay a liberal admission
to see this performance enacted.</p>

<p class="cap">One is apt to forget that the way of eternal life is the
way of nature; that the system of rewards and punishments
which God has provided for holiness and for
sin is in strict accord with the laws of nature. We are all aware
of the fact that we cannot sin against nature with impunity.
If we do violence to any of her laws we must make prompt and
strict payment for the offense. The proof of this is seen everywhere;
in the bent form, the hair prematurely gray, the halting
figure and the wrecks of manhood and womanhood that cross
our path daily. Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also
reap. If he sows the seeds of dissipation, he will surely reap a
harvest of disease, want, sorrow and misery. If he sows the
wind he will reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p class="cap">Every man has two natures. Under the influence of one
he descends to the carnal and base, under the influence
of the other he ascends to the spiritual and noble. It
is within the power of any man to pursue the former or the
latter. To assist him in achieving the latter he is offered a
model or a pattern by which he may work. With this pattern
in his eye, any one, however misshapen in mind or heart, may
work out for himself a moral image, grand, perfect and enduring.
In the person of Christ, God has shown us what a man
ought to be, and he will never be satisfied until we approach
that ideal.</p>

<p class="cap">It is claimed by many observers that a two-horse wagon has
never gone where the Bible did not go first. It is certainly
a significant fact that international commerce has everywhere
followed in the wake of the gospel. The intrepid
missionary invaded the wilds of China, India, Madagascar and
the islands of the southern sea long before the trading ships of
the merchants dared to enter their ports. Everywhere the foul
and ravenous beasts of tyranny, ignorance and superstition have
retired at the introduction of the glorious light of the cross.
Christianity has blazed the pathway and civilization has followed.
Now the rainbow arch of the gospel spans the continents
and seas, from Greenland’s icy mountains to India’s coral
strands, and we seem to hear the glad shout of ten million
ransomed souls who sing with the ancient Psalmist, “The entrance
of thy word giveth Light.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
